## <div align="center">Introduction</div>
In this study, an in-depth comparative experimental framework is established to scrutinize the effects of remote sensing image data sources and machine learning algorithms on the social functional classification of green spaces. The high-resolution CBERS-04A imagery (2m) is juxtaposed with medium-resolution data from Landsat TM (30m) and Sentinel-2 (10m), ensuring a level playing field by utilizing identical input parameters across the board. This meticulous approach allows for a clear delineation of the advantages and limitations inherent in various data resolutions for the purpose of green space analysis.
