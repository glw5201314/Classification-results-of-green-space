## <div align="center">Introduction</div>
Both the physical features and social functions of urban green space (UGS) are crucially important to the ecological and social benefits of urban residents.  Increasing attention has been focused on exploring how UGS social functions affect the ecological and social benefits of urban residents, but the social functional classification of UGS has rarely been studied and the related efficient classification method is urgently needed.  Thus, a novel methodological framework for accurately mapping UGS social functional zones was proposed by integrating remote sensing images, crowd-sourced geospatial data (i.e., point of interest data, OpenStreetMap road network, and Baidu Map boundary), and a deep learning algorithm.  The following is the result of our extraction of green space by different algorithms, SVM, RF, U-net, and their comparison.
